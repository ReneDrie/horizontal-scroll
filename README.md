# Horizontal Scrolling Manager

Example for custom horizontal scroll with Multiple blocks.
Build in [Vue Skeleton](https://github.com/hjeti/vue-skeleton).

It fakes all the Scrolling, so manually catches Key events, [MouseWheel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mouse-wheel) and Dragging (using GSAP Draggable).

## Run Project

You should be able to run `yarn` followed by `yarn dev` in the root.
